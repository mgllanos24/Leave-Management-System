## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Installation

1. **Download the system files** to your computer
2. **Install Python** (version 3.7 or later) from [python.org](https://python.org)
3. **Open a terminal/command prompt** in the system folder

### Step 2: Configuration

#### Email Notifications (Optional but Recommended)
1. Provide SMTP credentials via environment variables. Email delivery will
   fail fast during startup if these values are missing.
2. Create or update a `.env` file (or the deployment environment) with the
   required keys:
   ```bash
   # .env
   SMTP_SERVER=smtp.example.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USERNAME=notifications@example.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=replace-with-app-password
   ```
3. The bundled `server.py` loads the `.env` file during startup before importing
   the email service, ensuring the credentials are available both in
   development and production deployments that follow the same pattern.

#### Administrator Credentials

The server requires dedicated credentials for the administrator interface. Set
the following environment variables before launching the application:

- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: where approval and notification emails should be delivered.
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: the username administrators will use to sign in.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: a strong password for the administrator account.

The application will read these values from the surrounding environment or a
local `.env` file if present:

```bash
# .env
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
```

Make sure to generate unique, high-entropy secrets for production environments
and distribute them through your organisation's secret management tooling.

### Manual Verification

#### Leave Without Pay History Display

To confirm that leave without pay records appear under **Unpaid Hours** in the
Leave History views:

1. Start the development server as described in the Quick Start Guide.
2. Create or update a leave application with the leave type set to
   `Leave-Without-Pay` (hyphenated) or `Leave without pay` (spaced). Ensure it
   spans at least one working day.
3. Refresh the **Leave History** tab (or **Admin Leave History** for admin
   users).
4. Verify that the entry shows `0` under **Paid Hours** and the full duration of
   the leave under **Unpaid Hours**.

These steps confirm the UI correctly classifies leave without pay as unpaid
even when no balance history record is associated with the application.

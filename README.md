## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Installation

1. **Download the system files** to your computer
2. **Install Python** (version 3.7 or later) from [python.org](https://python.org)
3. **Open a terminal/command prompt** in the system folder

### Step 2: Configuration

#### Email Notifications
SMTP settings are now hardcoded in `services/email_service.py`, so no environment
variables are required for configuration. **Warning:** hardcoding credentials is
insecure. Keep the repository private and consider moving these settings to a
separate configuration file that is excluded from version control.

#### Employee Records
Ensure each employee record includes a valid `personal_email` address. Leave
approval will fail if this field is empty, and administrators will be
notified.
